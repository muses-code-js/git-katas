# Squash commits

In this kata I would like to clean up my history a bit.

The five newest commits all tinker with file.txt which obviously contains my feature.

I would like these commits to be squashed into a single commit!

While you are at it I would really like the ugly `\n` characters inside `file.txt` to be removed from the history.

## Setup

1. Run `./setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## Task

1. _Squash_ the five relevant commits into one, cleaning up the commit msg of one of the commits
1. How does `git log` look now?

### Relevant commands

- `git rebase -i <ref>`
- `git rev-parse <ref>`
