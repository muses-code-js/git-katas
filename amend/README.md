# Git kata: Amending commits
When we are working, we make a lot of commits.
Sometimes we just forget something obvious that we want to fix quickly.

`git commit --amend` allows us to do that - tinker with the last commit we made.

## Setup:

1. Run `./setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## The task
1. What does `git status` tell us?
1. What does `git log` tell us?
1. Stage the addition of bar.txt
1. Run `git commit --amend`
1. What happened? What does `git log` tell us?
1. What happens if you run `git commit --amend` again?
