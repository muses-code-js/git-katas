1. Run `./setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## Detached head state

The user has ended up in a "detached head" state.

This is a scary situation for the user, but as we know, git is not scary.

Run `git status` - see what is going on.

Restore normalcy in this repository by moving to `master`

Note that this task might seem more confusing if you did not run `setup.sh` in your terminal.

## extra

We want to have a branch called `the-beginning` that is made from the first commit with message `A`

How would you do this?
