## Quick Start

### In the Cloud

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/praqma-training/git-katas.git)

### On Your Local Machine

![Quick Start](/images/quickstart.gif)

- Clone this repository
- Go into the folder you want to solve an exercise in
- Run the `setup.sh` script
- Consult the README.md in that folder to get a description of the exercise

## Purpose of Git Katas

This repository is a collection of Git exercises.
The concept is stolen without shame from [Schauderhaft.de](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/gitkata/).
Unfortunately, they have not maintained the system - and we need more good Git exercises.

The exercises are designed for use when we are teaching Git courses. You should be able to use them as self-contained exercises that will allow you to keep your Git skills sharp.

Exercises starting with _basic_ are entry-level - other exercises vary greatly in difficulty.

To get an overview of the exercises in here look in [Overview.md](Overview.md).

Feel free to use these exercises, that's why they're public!

## Contributing

If you miss exercises or find errors in any of them, feel free to improve them and make a pull request.

You can also make an issue so we notice an opportunity to improve!

Thank you!

## Cheatsheet

A collection of useful commands to use throughout the exercises:

```shell
# Cloning a repository
git clone https://github.com/praqma-training/git-katas.git      # Clone this repository to your current working directory

# See local changes
git status                  # Show the working tree status
git diff                    # Show changes current working directory (not yet staged)
git diff --cached           # Show changes currently staged for commit

# Add files to staging (before a commit)
git add myfile.txt          # Add myfile.txt to stage
git add .                   # Add entire working directory to stage

# Make a commit
git commit                              # Make a new commit with the changes in your staging area. This will open an editor for a commit message.
git commit -m "I love documentation"    # Make a new commit with a commit message from the command line
git commit -a                           # Make a new commit and automatically "add" changes from all known files
git commit -am "I still do!"            # A combination of the above
git commit --amend                      # Re-do the commit message of the previous commit (don't do this after pushing!)
                                        #   We _never_ change "public history"

# Configuring a different editor
## Avoid Vim but stay in terminal:
- `git config --global core.editor nano`

## For Windows:
- Use Notepad:
`git config --global core.editor notepad`

- or for instance Notepad++:
`git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`

# See history
git log             # Show commit logs
git log --oneline   # Formats commits to a single line (shorthand for --pretty=oneline  --abbrev-commit )
git log --graph     # Show a graph commits and branches

# Working with Branches
git branch my-branch       # Create a new branch called my-branch
git checkout my-branch     # Checkout ("Switch" to work on) my-branch
git checkout -b my-branch  # Create a new branch called my-branch AND switch to it
git branch -d my-branch    # Delete branch my-branch that has been merged with master
git branch -D my-branch    # Forcefully delete a branch my-branch that hasn't been merged to master

# Merging
git merge master         # Merge the master branch into your currently checked out branch.
git rebase master        # Rebase current branch on top of master branch

# Working with Remotes
git remote              # Show your current remotes
git remote -v           # Show your current remotes and their URLs
git push                # Publish your commits to the upstream master of your currently checked out branch
git pull                # Pull changes from the remote to your currently checked out branch

# Aliases - it's possible to make aliases of frequently used commands
#   This is often done to make a command shorter, or to add default flags

# Adding a shorthand "co" for "checkout"
git config --global alias.co "checkout"
# Usage:
git co      # Does a "git checkout"

## Logging
git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all # Show a nice graph of the previous commits
## Adding an alias called "lol" (log oneline..) that shows the above
git config --global alias.lol "log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all"
## Using the alias
git lol     # Does a "git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all"
```

## Testing

There is a very small test that you can run in powershell or bash.
It is contained in the scripts `test.sh` and `test.ps1`.
