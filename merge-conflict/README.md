# Git Kata: Merge Conflict

## Setup:

1. Run `./setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## The task

In this kata git cannot figure how to merge the content added on `merge-conflict-branch1` with the content on `master`.

Both changes need to be in master when you're done.

## Relevant commands
- `git merge`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
