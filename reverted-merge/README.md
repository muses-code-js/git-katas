# Git Kata: Reverted merge

In this kata, we explore the problems of reverting a merge commit.

## The story

Your team uses this amazing library-1.2.3 for its development, which is
maintained by another team.

At some point, your team integrates a new version library-1.2.4. Because you are
prudent, you do this on a branch `integrate-library-1.2.4`.

Unfortunately, you discover after your merge that the library has a bug, which
has to be fixed by this other team. To prevent the bug from being released into
production, you decide to revert the merge commit.

## Setup

1. Run `./setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## The task

* Revert the merge commit
  *Note: You may assume that feature Y is also working with the old library version*
* Take the role of the library team and fix the bug in the library on the branch
* Explore how you can get the changes from the branch into the master again
  Try to merge first to see what happens

For in depth discussion of some the the issues that can happen when reverting a merge commit consult this gist:

## Useful commands

* `git rebase`
