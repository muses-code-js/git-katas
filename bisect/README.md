# Bisect

The master branch is broken, now I wish we used pretested integration. I have been gone some days on vacation and now when I'm back I realize that master is broken and has been broken for a while. All the pull requests have been working but everyone have been too busy to realize that the master build is failing.

I would like to know what commit introduced the test failure. But it seems that it's too hard to figure out by hand, the test is complicated and there are so many commits to go through and no one changed the test script.

Let's try to use `git bisect` to find what commit broke the build.

Luckily I added a tag `initial-commit` when the project started which we can use to start searching for the bug.

To get help on how to use bisect I can always run `git bisect --help`.

To run the tests I can execute the test script:
```
$ ./test.sh
```
## Setup:

1. Run `./setup.sh`

## Tasks

1. Use `git bisect` to locate the bad commit

## Verify

When I'm done I may test the solution with the verify script

```
$ cd ..
$ ./verify.sh
```

## If I get stuck

I found this manual that I can use if I get stuck:


```
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad
$ git bisect good initial-commit
$ git bisect run './test.sh'
```
